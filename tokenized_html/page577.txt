left him enthusiastic when kenny left the addition he left with a songwriter s contract in hand kenny chesney a year later in 1993 kenny made an appearance at a local songwriter s showcase this

has created some of alberta s and canada s most enduring standards not to mention a career spanning over five decades his music has inspired such renowned artists such as bob dylan neil young and gordon lightfoot consequently over the years tyson has continued to create music that captures life in the west through vivid descriptions of alberta and cowboy culture not to mention a leading spokesman for western pride including helping establish a unique soundtrack to capture the alberta experience born in victoria british columbia in 1933 the second child of george and margaret tyson

were the canadian stars of the early 60s folk boom ian and sylvia enjoyed great success they were playing all over the country receiving rave reviews and playing to sold-out crowds one of their high lights was playing new york s carnegie hall the duo married in 1964 forming what was to become one of the most influential country acts in the industry both in canada and abroad they recorded over a dozen timeless albums as well as wrote some of canada s best-loved songs including ian s four strong winds as well as someday soon including sylvia s you were on my mind all things considered some of

truck in 1927 fire fighters of the merritt fire department at the regular meeting of the city council held last night the most important communication to be dealt with and a mighty important one to the people of merritt it was one from fire chief n.j. barwick notifying council that unless their requests for better fighting equipment were granted they were tendering their resignations to take effect on november 10th 1926 his worship the mayor and alderman of the city of merritt gentlemen we received your letter of october the 22nd in answer to our letters of june 8th and also of october the 14th we asked for better firefighting equipment at a regular fire dept meeting held in the fire hall on the 28th of october we as a body did not approve of the action you have taken if you will take into consideration we have advance 45 of the cost of the equipment however that is up to you gentlemen for we feel we do not care to carry on with the very poor equipment you have at present therefore as a body tender our resignation to take effect on the morning of november the 10th 1926 signed on behalf of myself and fire boys n.j. barwick information merritt herald and merritt museum the new fire truck for the city of merritt fire brigade arrived at the local kettle valley railway depot on monday evening and its addition to the fire fighting equipment for the local fire boys should be a valuable acquisition the truck was supplied by the american la france fire engine company who lost no time in shipping the truck when the order was finally placed with them by the merritt city council indeed it was not expected to arrive from the works at toronto until the first of february the truck is modernly equipped for the use of both hose and chemicals it is mounted upon a general motors chevrolet one truck chassis by the r.f barrett firm of this city the value of this fire truck to the local fire department should be excellent this added assistance to the fire boys will be fully appreciated by all citizens information merritt herald and merritt museum bob wilson a paid on call fireman is pictured along side the 1926 fire engine this fire engine serviced the community up until 1960 this particular fire engine is known as a chemical car the plan is to hopefully replicate the soda acid tanks that were used in this era soda acid tank sulphuric acid when combined with bicarbonate of soda forms a chemical reaction which produces carbon dioxide when mixed the pressure created forces the mixture out of the chemical tank and propels it onto the fire it was a very good show lots of variety of vehicles and happy people yvonne tessier you never know what you might see at the nicola valley cruisers car show 2019 saw over 150 cars registered so watch for
