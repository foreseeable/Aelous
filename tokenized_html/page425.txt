pros and cons review of excellence punta cana punta cana dominican republic tripadvisor we came back yesterday from secrets there were pros and cons regarding this trip and hotel the ride from the airport is long about an hour and quite bumpy there are no traffic laws in the dominican no lights just an occasional stop sign the roads are horrendous so many potholes that the driver has to swerve to avoid them other vehicles pass on either side as you travel all you see is cow pastures and total poverty you start feeling guilty that you re on vacation when you see how the native people live they live in what we consider our tool shed in little commune type areas once you arrive at secrets you are totally cordially welcomed with mimosas and warm face cloths you ll need both it s extremely hot and muggy and the ride as i mentioned is overwhelming thankfully our room was ready we were told we arrived late afternoon we journeyed to our room by a friendly bell boy he told us where to find certain things we may need the iron and ironing board how to turn on the lights electricity is a rare commodity in the dr and where our minifridge was located the minifridge had not been stocked not to worry he told us he would get someone up right away to stock it five phone calls and two days later it was stocked they provide you with beer water sparkling water coke sprite we came back yesterday from secrets there were pros and cons regarding this trip and hotel the ride from the airport is long about an hour and quite bumpy there are no traffic laws in the dominican no lights just an occasional stop sign the roads are horrendous so many potholes that the driver has to swerve to avoid them other vehicles pass on either side as you travel all you see is cow pastures and total poverty you start feeling guilty that you 're on vacation when you see how the native people live they live in what we consider our tool shed in little commune type areas once you arrive at secrets you are totally cordially welcomed with mimosas and warm face cloths you 'll need both it 's extremely hot and muggy and the ride as i mentioned is overwhelming thankfully our room was ready we were told we arrived late afternoon we journeyed to our room by a friendly bell boy he told us where to find certain things we may need the iron and ironing board how to turn on the lights electricity is a rare commodity in the dr and where our minifridge was located the minifridge had not been stocked not to worry he told us he would get someone up right away to stock it five phone calls and two days later it was stocked they provide you with beer water sparkling water coke sprite and a bottle of rum which they replenish every day based on consumption do not expect fast service or for anything you eat or drink to be hot or cold depending on what you 're ordering the minifridge contents never get cold and ice is another rare commodity br since you ca n't drink the water bottled water is a must we would n't even brush our teeth in the water too many horror stories about people getting sick also our telephone between the beds small double bed did n't work neither did our tv remote control you really do n't get anywhere calling the desk they tell you they 'll take care of it in 5 minutes after two days you just give up it 's not worth it and it 's too hot to argue on our second to last day there we had an unfortunate accident the palapa thatched hut we were sitting under came crashing down on us needless to say it was scary and unexpected and we had to be treated by medical personnel thankfully we escaped with a goose egg on my head and a cut to my husband 's leg it was not fun but the hotel staff could n't be nicer and felt terrible about the whole thing they offered us a free night 's stay we passed and sent a bottle of very nice wine to our table that night the doctor even came to our room later in the day to make sure we were both ok they provided us with everything we requested copy of the report pictures and were very cordial as they were for the entire stay there 's not alot to do off the hotel site a couple of excursions mostly all day but it 's so hot and humid and very buggy that you stay put at the hotel they spray for bugs nightly even when you 're eating which is not the greatest feeling they need to though as the bugs eat you alive bug spray is very important to bring they do have daily things to do and they try to keep you interested and occupied the hotel is gorgeous with what seems to be miles of pool they have a swim up bar which is lots of fun and everyone is friendly visitors and staff alike the beach is beautiful but it is on the atlantic ocean side so the undertow is powerful to say the least bring plenty of sunscreen the sun is strong and you can get burned very quickly all in all we enjoyed our stay but were not unhappy to be coming home bottom line is do n't drink the water do n't expect quick service and bring sunscreen and bug spray the people are extremely friendly and the hotel is quite beautiful that 's why i 'm giving it an above average rating thanks for reading i did seem to go on forever more my husband and i have been to sandals all over the caribbean 18 times we 're not knocking it but secrets is just different our trip to secrets punta cana was one of the best as far as all -inclusives go- this is top notch very classy elegant and romantic no kids dating drinking too much and acting like idiots at the bar the resort gives off an atmosphere of maturity but at the same time is so much fun that you feel like a kid br if you read reveiws with complaints-ignore them br eg. the ride from the airport is long and bumpy but no one mentioned that the airport is beautiful and where does anyone live without pot holes br as far as not getting the room they requested rather than jumping down the throat of the under paid guest abused check -in clerk ask nicely to be moved and say quot por favor quot mistakes happen and can be corrected but for only those who deserve it. br seven restaurants excluding breakfast all al la cart most other resorts offer buffet lunch we sat down to meals the size of dinner for lunch every day did n't barely have room for dinner because the food was so good for those who thought the food was bad i 'd like to know where they eat beacause we were over-pleased br rooms were wonderful room 10207 clean from what i heard from other guests every room was nice ca n't beat a jucuzzi with a daily stocked mini bar in the room br one down fall mosquitos this resort is near a jungle but we did our homework brought off and bug spray and it was n't bad at all. br we 're home now and would do anything to go back and get bit by a mosquito. br horseback riding was great rented 4 wheel atv and toured outskirt towns spa services were wonderful and all staff were extremely helpful remember they do n't understand our language any more then we understood theirs everything works both ways. br beach was very clean huge so many other islands have had their beaches washed away by hurricanes this one is a walk to the water it was great. br do n't believe the negative comments you read obviously some people have a bad attitude go into everything open minded and you will be pleasantly surprised. br we are home 36 hours and already planning our next trip to secrets punta cana br feel free to email for further comments. p ask venture9250 about excellence punta cana 3 thank venture9250 this review is the subjective opinion of a tripadvisor member and not of tripadvisor llc backpacker10555 philadelphia pa 1 2 reviewed 19 october 2003 beware just got back yesterday october 18 2003 and if you are going to secrets in punta cana beware of the mosquitos they are everywhere all the time i have no less than 50 bites during my 6 days the only thing that works at a little is anything with deet also secrets itself was a disappointment it was beautiful as it seems but they have a lot of maintenance problems our room had a leak from the toilet above us gross we had an excellence suite which was beautiful but we had our share of problems the electricity goes off and on the air condititioning is never really cold enough the in room refrigerator is never really cold and the mosquitos somehow found there way in all day long their are maintenance people around banging and fixing so do n't try and relax in your room at all during the day in the fitness center half the equipment worked when we went for a massage the beautiful relaxing music started shutting off and on then getting real real loud then real soft then shutting off it was almost funny afterwards when we went to take a shower none of the showers worked and the power was off as i was trying to get changed they kept coming in and out and leaving the door open and anyone could look right in my husband wanted to take a steam but that did n't work either the staff is nice enough but if you think they understand you and nod and say si they probably do not have a clue the drinks are so watered down you can drink all night and never feel a thing the food is just ok in the different restaurants however the french restaurant is outstanding i would't go any other place but there the pools are also very nice and the beach is beautiful also another funny thing are the pool rafts they are really nice but try and get one people take them to their rooms so the chances of getting one are very slim also the domincan airport is a mess when you go to leave it took more than 3 1/2 hours to get from the first line to boarding the plan there are 5+ lines you have to get in the luggage search line the airline line the immigration line the security line the boarding pass line and also another impromptu search line which uses three plastic picnic tables to place your luggage on and search again their computers as usual i 'm told where down so no one could get a boarding pass they had little slips of paper and walked up and down the line looking for names so people could board also the airport is totally open no air conditioning and it is hot and humid in the dr after waiting in that line for over an hour a passenger revolt was imminent the us air representative used a cell phone to check the passenger list he finally let us through to board and then yelled out our seat assignments as we ran to the plane so in view of the constant bugs the resort and the airport experience i can say most definitely that i would never go to the domincan republic again what can i say it was fantastic we actually booked the sunscape and they were overbooked we we got there and we were asked if we wanted to move to secrets at no extra charge it was a huge upgrade we were almost scared to do it because it sounded too good but we went for it and werent sorry we saw people during the week when we took an excursion who were staying at the sunscape and they were a little unhappy with that resort and they also had the chance to move and didnt and we were talking about how beautiful secrets was and they could of kicked themselves for not taking the upgrade the ride as everyone says was bumpy and it was quite a way from the airport compared to the sunscape but once we got there it didnt matter once we arrived at secrets they gave us a welcome drink and a cool towel i said to my husband did we survive the plane ride i thought we had died and gone to heaven the room was large and very clean each room has a jacuzzi in it there was even a phone in the bathroom there was a nice balcony with a view of the ocean the service at the restaurants and bars was excellent the food was good the talk about the restaurants was to go to the one that was in the hotel lobby area it was supposed to be out of this world there was always people waiting to get in to it we saved it for our last night and we were satisfied with it but we really thought it was no different than any of the others they were all very good for lunch or a late night snack try a pizza i couldnt believe how good it was the beach grounds and pools are beautiful the pool was so nice it had a waterfall floating chaises and a swim-up bar one night they had an out door buffet you could eat right on the beach if you wanted they had tables with white linen cloths and candles it was so romantic it was a little windy but it didnt matter br bugs generally didnt bother us there was one night for some reason they were really bad and we were eating in an open air restaurant and they were biting us but other than than no problem this was a classier resort than some others i have stayed in so if it 's beach girls/boys gone wild your looking for this would not suite you there was a casino and a disco i 'm not really a gambler but i put a few dollars in and won a little the disco was fun each night in the lobby bar they had dance lessons bingo or a show which was nice the dance show was out of this world there was a group that traveled around to the different resorts and performed and even my husband who is not really interested in a las vegas style show was impressed we actually saw this show 2 times because we stayed at the sunscape resort the first night we were there and they had performed there we then watched it again at secrets and still enjoyed it we took one excursion it was to snorkle and swim with stingrays and sharks then a short tour of the other resorts along the coast and then we got into a small cove where the water was shallow and we were given floaties and a water waiter came out with drinks and served us in the water to finally wrap this review up go to dr and stay at secrets you will not be disappointed my husband and are have traveled extensively to many islands and stayed at many different resorts this was our first time to both the dr and secrets excellence we could not have dreamed for a better vacation we stayed at secrets from oct. 4-11 everything about this place is spectacular from the decor to food/drink layout of property beach and pool areas as well as the activities available my best recommendation would be to grab a cab at the aiport to get to the resort if you see a large tour bus waiting to take you to the resort it 's pretty much a sure fire bet that that bus will be making several stops at other resorts before getting to secrets as secrets is the one of the farther resorts we took the advice of other reviews on this site and took a cab it was by far the best 50.00 we spent we arrived at the hotel approximately one and a half hours before the bus that we should have been on and were able to check-in immediately to begin our vacation our check-in was painless we received the room we had requested when booking with no trouble at all keep in mind that balcony door must be securely closed for the air conditioner to kick on room was always clean and well stocked with supplies daily we did take advantage of reviews we read and left the maid several dollars each day rather than one large tip at the end of the week and this seemed to work extremely well we also left a note in spanish neither of us are fluent we brought a small travel spanish book with us if there was anything additional that we needed it 's also a good idea to take 100 in 1 's and 50-100 in 5 's while no one on the staff expects a tip they certainly deserve it for the service they provide and how hard they work we met a number of wonderful people who shared our opinions about the resort and the service while we did not opt to take any of the offsite tours ourselves we did hear that the outback safari tour and the speedboat/snorkel tour were very good bugs were not a huge problem but we did bring spray and did use it most nights try to remember to complete the survey book upon checkout and be sure to include names of any staff members that you felt stood out for their exceptional service as it really does affect their rate of pay and promotion level there are many many more wonderful things that i could say about this resort suffice it to say that my husband and i would return without question the next time we vacation in the dr. have a wonderful time boy whats can i say my wife and i were 1st time travelers to the d.r found secrets excellence everthing that the net reviews offered sure the bus ride was a little bad but got to see the true dominican countryside the resort itself is beautiful staff at check in were very helpful we did have the wrong room tho but after talking to oscar at the front desk within a half hr we were changed to the room that we ordered the staff at the resort were fantastic everyone with a nice smile and willing to help 3 of our favorites were nathaniel at the higuey resturant felix the breakfast cook and jose the bartender at the santo domingo bar area.oh also the beach and scenery there is fantastic i could go on and on but just go and see for yourself p ask
