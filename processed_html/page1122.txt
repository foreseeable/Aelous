Freeware - Wikipedia Freeware  is  software , most often  proprietary , that is distributed at no monetary cost to the  end user . There is no agreed-upon set of rights,  license , or  EULA  that defines  freeware  unambiguously; every publisher defines its own rules for the freeware it offers. For instance,  modification ,  redistribution  by third parties, and  reverse engineering  without the author's permission are permitted by some publishers but prohibited by others. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ]  Unlike with  free and open-source software , which are also often distributed free of charge, the  source code  for freeware is typically not made available. [ 1 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ]  Freeware may be intended to benefit its producer by, for example, encouraging sales of a more capable version, as in the  freemium  and  shareware business models . [ 6 ] The term  freeware  was coined in 1982 [ 7 ]  by  Andrew Fluegelman , who wanted to sell  PC-Talk , the communications application he had created, outside of commercial distribution channels. [ 8 ]  Fluegelman distributed the program via a process now termed  shareware . [ 9 ] In the 1980s and 1990s, the term  freeware  was often applied to software released without  source code . [ 3 ] [ 10 ] Software classified as freeware may be used without payment and is typically either fully functional for an unlimited time or has limited functionality, with a more capable version available commercially or as shareware. [ 11 ] In contrast to what the  Free Software Foundation  calls  free software , the author of freeware usually restricts the rights of the user to use, copy, distribute, modify, make derivative works, or  reverse engineer  the software. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ]  The  software license  may impose additional usage restrictions; [ 14 ]  for instance, the license may be "free for private, non-commercial use" only, [ citation needed ]  or usage over a network, on a server, or in combination with certain other software packages may be prohibited. [ 12 ] [ 13 ]  Restrictions may be required by license or enforced by the software itself; e.g., the package may fail to function over a network. [ citation needed ] The  U.S. Department of Defense  (DoD) defines "open source software" (i.e., free software or free and open-source software), as distinct from "freeware" or "shareware"; it is software where "the Government does not have access to the original source code". [ 4 ]  The "free" in "freeware" refers to the price of the software, which is typically  proprietary  and distributed without source code. By contrast, the "free" in "free software" refers to freedoms granted users under the software license (for example, to run the program for any purpose, modify and redistribute the program to others), and such software may be sold at a price. According to the  Free Software Foundation  (FSF), "freeware" is a loosely defined category and it has no clear accepted definition, although FSF asks that  free software  (libre; unrestricted and with source code available) should not be called freeware. [ 3 ] In contrast the Oxford English Dictionary simply characterizes freeware as being "available free of charge (sometimes with the suggestion that users should make a donation to the provider)". [ 15 ] Some freeware products are released alongside paid versions that either have more features or less restrictive licensing terms. This approach is known as  freemium  ("free" + "premium"), since the free version is intended as a promotion for the premium version. [ 16 ]  The two often share a code base, using a  compiler flag  to determine which is produced. For example,  BBEdit  has a  BBEdit Lite  edition which has fewer features.  XnView  is available free of charge for personal use but must be licensed for commercial use. The free version may be advertising supported, as was the case with the  DivX . Ad-supported software  and free registerware also bear resemblances to freeware. Ad-supported software does not ask for payment for a license, but displays advertising to either compensate for development costs or as a means of income. Registerware forces the user to subscribe with the publisher before being able to use the product. While commercial products  may require registration to ensure licensed use , free registerware do not. [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] The  Creative Commons  offer  licenses , applicable to all by copyright governed works including software, [ 21 ]  which allow a developer to define "freeware" in a legal safe and internationally law domains respecting way. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ]  The typical freeware use case "share" can be further refined with Creative Commons restriction clauses like non-commerciality ( CC BY-NC ) or no- derivatives  ( CC BY-ND ), see  description of licenses . [ original research? ]  There are  several usage examples , for instance  The White Chamber ,  Mari0  or  Assault Cube [ 25 ] , all freeware by being  CC BY-NC-SA  licensed: free sharing allowed, selling not. Freeware cannot economically rely on commercial promotion. In May 2015 advertising freeware on  Google AdWords  was restricted to "authoritative source"[s]. [ 26 ]  Thus web sites and  blogs  are the primary resource for information on which freeware is available, useful, and is not  malware . However, there are also many  computer magazines  or newspapers that provide ratings for freeware and include compact discs or other  storage media  containing freeware. Freeware is also often  bundled  with other products such as  digital cameras  or  scanners . Freeware has been criticized as "unsustainable" because it requires a single entity to be responsible for updating and enhancing the product, which is then given away without charge. [ 16 ]  Other freeware projects are simply released as  one-off  programs with no promise or expectation of further development. These may include  source code , as does free software, so that users can make any required or desired changes themselves, but this code remains subject to the license of the compiled executable and does not constitute free software.
