Terminally ill Janet Tracey was not consulted before 'do not resuscitate' notice was placed on her medical records, judge rules | Daily Mail Online         By                    Louise Eccles for the Daily Mail               13:44 EST 19 Dec 2012                 , updated                 08:11 EST 20 Dec 2012         Doctors placed a do not resuscitate order on a patient’s notes without her knowledge or consent, a High Court judge said yesterday. Grandmother Janet Tracey, 63, had terminal lung cancer when she was admitted to hospital with a fractured neck following a serious car accident. Despite her poor prognosis, her family say she ‘wanted to have every minute of every day’ and told doctors she wanted to be included in conversations about her care. So she was ‘distressed’ to discover in March last year that a Do Not Attempt Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation (DNA-CPR) order had been placed on her notes.  When Mrs Tracey objected, it was cancelled by staff at Addenbrooke’s Hospital, in Cambridge, only to be reinstated three days later. Mrs Tracey died two days after the second notice was issued. Yesterday, Judge Nicola Davies said she did not accept the evidence of Dr Andrea Lavinio, a consultant on the neuro-critical care unit, that he had discussed the first order with Mrs Tracey but forgot to record it in her medical notes In written findings, she said: ‘There is nothing in the records which suggests any agreement to DNA-CPR by Mrs Tracey.’ She said Dr Lavinio may have kept Mrs Tracey in the dark to ‘spare her a conversation which he knew was likely to cause distress to a suffering patient’. But the findings will reignite the debate over whether patients have the right to decide whether they are resuscitated, or whether the doctor always knows best. Clinicians are not required by law to gain the consent of patients, but hospital policy states they should discuss it where possible. The Tracey family claim their mother’s human rights were breached and that Cambridgeshire University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust acted unlawfully when they ignored her wishes. They will find out tomorrow whether the case can proceed to a judicial review, where they can challenge the trust’s policy and the national guidelines set down by the Secretary of State for Health. The family’s QC, Philip Havers, told London’s High Court: ‘When the case is a matter of life or death, it is not good enough for a trust to have a policy that is confusing. ‘There is a real problem out there and this is not a hypothetical or academic issue.’ After the first DNA-CPR order was removed, a second one was placed on Mrs Tracey’s medical records three days later when her condition deteriorated. Mrs Tracey’s four daughters and husband, retired engineer David, 65, say they were not properly informed about this notice either. But Judge Davies accepted the evidence of medical staff who said Mrs Tracey did not want to discuss her prognosis and that doctors ‘had discussed the relevant issues with the family’. She said staff believed 'her family were in denial as to her prognosis'.  Judge Davies said: ‘Amongst clinicians responsible for the care of Mrs Tracey, there was unanimity: a DNA-CPR order was appropriate in order to protect her from an undignified and cruel procedure which was of no clinical benefit.’ Mrs Tracey’s four daughters, including Alison Noeland who attended court yesterday, say they were given graphic accounts of resuscitation to pressure them to agree to a second DNA-CPR. Daughter Kate Master told the hearing: ‘They said they would jump up and down on mum’s chest. ‘They would burn her with electrodes, they would break her ribs that weren’t already broken.’ Lord Faulks QC, speaking on behalf of the hospital, said: ‘Whether or not to give CPR in circumstances like this is a matter for the clinicians, ultimately.’ The comments below have been moderated
