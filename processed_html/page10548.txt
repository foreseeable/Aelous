Dance-rock - Wikipedia Dance-rock  is a  post-disco  genre connected with  pop rock  and  post-punk  with fewer  rhythm and blues  influences, originated in the early 1980s, following the decline in popularity of  punk  and  disco . [ 2 ] Examples of early dance-rock include  Gina X 's "No G.D.M.", [ 3 ] Russ Ballard 's "On The Rebound", [ 4 ]  artists such as  Dinosaur L ,  Liquid Liquid  and  Polyrock , [ 5 ]  and the compilation album  Disco Not Disco . [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Michael Campbell, in his book  Popular Music in America , defines the genre as "post-punk/post-disco fusion". Campbell also cited  Robert Christgau , who described dance-oriented rock (or DOR) as an umbrella term used by various DJs in the 1980s. [ 8 ] However,  AllMusic  defines "dance-rock" as 1980s and 1990s music practiced by rock musicians, influenced by  Philly soul , disco and funk, fusing those styles with rock and dance. Artists like  The Rolling Stones ,  David Bowie ,  Duran Duran ,  Simple Minds ,  INXS ,  Eurythmics ,  Depeche Mode ,  The Clash ,  New Order  and  Devo  belong, according to Allmusic, to this genre. Dance-rock embraces some experimental funk acts like  A Certain Ratio ,  Gang of Four , and also musicians, for example  Robert Palmer ,  Billy Idol  and  Hall  &  Oates . This kind of dance-rock influenced acts such as  Garbage ,  No Doubt ,  Robbie Williams ,  Scissor Sisters , [ 9 ] Young Love ,  Franz Ferdinand ,  Arctic Monkeys ,  Kasabian  and  The Killers . [ 10 ] Despite predictions that rock music would replace disco in the dance clubs, a mix of post-disco, post-punk, and new wave took its place instead. The first wave of artists arrived with  New Order ,  Prince ,  Human League ,  Blondie ,  Tom Tom Club  and  Devo , followed by  Daryl Hall  &  John Oates ,  Thompson Twins ,  Haircut 100 ,  ABC ,  Depeche Mode  and  Spandau Ballet . [ 2 ]  The scene also produced a lot of crossovers, including  Kraftwerk  getting  R & B  audiences with their 1981 influential album  Computer World , which paved the way for  Afrika Bambaataa 's " Planet Rock " and  electro  in general. Reinstated interest in dance-rock and post-disco caused popularity of 12-inch singles and EPs around that era. [ 2 ] [ 11 ] Key influences of the genre include  New Romantic synthpop  acts  Human League  and  Spandau Ballet  while, according to  Billboard , the pivotal record of the genre is Human League's " Don't You Want Me ".  Arthur Baker  argued that synthesizers helped to shape the new music: "I'm into synthesizers right now. The options are limitless. It cuts costs and gives you more ultimate control, but it doesn't sound made up. It still has a human feel", while the sound, composed of electronic  Eurodisco  influences, was generally regarded as "cold, anti-human and mechanical." [ 2 ]
